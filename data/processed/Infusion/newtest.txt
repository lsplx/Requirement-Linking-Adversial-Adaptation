Labels may show additional information. Labels should be difficult to counterfeit or modify without detection  only created and attached to filled prescriptions by a pharmacist in the hospital pharmacy.^^Fluid Subsystem The fluid subsystem moves drug from the reservoir to the line to the patient and is depicted in Figure 9. The drug flows from the reservoir  through the upstream monitor to the pump  then through the downstream monitor to the tube to the patient.^^0
prescription confirmation. An authorized clinician must personally confirm the prescription is authentic and meant for the patient to be infused. The routine procedures by which clinicians load the drug reservoir must ensure that the prescription  lled by an authorized pharmacist at the hospital pharmacy is meant for the patient (to be) connected to the PCA pump.^^Fluid Subsystem: Drug Reservoir The drug reservoir holds liquid drug until infused.^^0
prescription authentication. Drug container must have a valid prescription  filled by an authorized pharmacist  for the particular patient to be infused by the PCA pump.^^Operational Subsystem: Drug Library Thread The drug library thread stores the drug library provided by the hospital pharmacy  and retrieves the drug record corresponding to the drug loaded into the reservoir.^^0
bolus over-infusion alarm. If delivered patient-requested bolus flow rate exceeds the prescribed patient-requested bolus rate setting by more than its allowed tolerance over a period of more than 1 minute or immediately if the pump goes into free flow  the pump shall issue a bolus over-infusion alarm. (EC 3.2.7).^^Fluid Subsystem: Patient Button The patient button allows the patient to request an extra bolus of drug on demand. It may be connected by wire or RF to the PCA pump so that it is conveniently located for the patient.^^0
patient-requested bolus. A patient-requested bolus shall be delivered at its prescribed rate  Fbolus  in addition to the prescribed basal flow rate Fbasal  but no more than the maximim flow rate for the pump  Fmax.^^Operation Subsystem: Operation Thread The operation thread performs primary pump operation control.^^1
prescription confirmation. Required when changing prescription during infusion^^Safety Subsystem: Pump Fault Manager The pump fault manager determines if the measured upstream and downstream flow rates are within tolerance of the speci ed rate  and aggregates other pump fault indications into a combined pump fault indication.^^0
